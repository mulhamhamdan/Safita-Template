        History
      </h3>
      <p>
          Safita is located on a site where remains of the
          Phoenician settlement were discovered. The archaeological
          remains at the site of Tell Kazel were identified as the 
          Phoenician city of Sumur mentioned in the Amarna letters.

        Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse founded the County of 
        Tripoli. The Knights Templar, to whom the lands of the 
        region were given, built the fortress known today as the "Chastel Blanc"
        . The fortress sits on a strategic observation point, and from there 
        it maintains eye contact with the network of fortresses of the Templar Order,
        Arwad and Tartus on the coast in the northwest, Chastel Rouge in the
        southwest and Krak des Chevaliers in the southeast. The Mamluk Sultan 
        Baibars managed to capture Safita in 1271 to become under Muslim rule.

        Ottoman era
      </h3>
      <p>
        Safita was the center of the principal nahiya 
        (subdistrict) of the southern Syrian Coastal
        Mountain Range during the Ottoman rule through 
        the 16th and early 17th centuries, spanning about
        forty villages and, at times, including the subdistricts 
        of Mi'ar, Qulay'a and Tartus within its jurisdiction.
        The Sayfa dynasty, based in the hinterland of Tripoli,
        controlled the town until 1640, often using its fortress in
        their wars with the Druze Ma'an dynasty of Mount Lebanon.
        In 1621 Yusuf Sayfa dispatched a force against his nephew, and 
        ally of the Ma'anid Fakhr ad-Din II, Sulayman, 
        in Safita for not forwarding the subdistrict's tax revenue to
        Tripoli
      </p>
      <p>
                After 1640, Safita is seldom mentioned in the historical 
                chronicles of the middle Ottoman period. However, court records in
                Tripoli Sanjak, of which Safita was part, the earliest of which 
                date to 1666 and 1667 indicate the iltizam (tax farms)
                of the Safita nahiya were sold to the Alawite brothers 
                Muhammad and Zaydan, sons of Shamsin in 1667–1668. They were 
                charged with collecting taxes on behalf of the government
                on fruit trees, agricultural lands, falcons, bees, silk,
                flour mills, buffalo, wave labor, festivals, weddings 
                and wintering camps of Turkmen and Arab nomads.
                The Shamsin family emerged as the dominant local force 
                of Safita until the late 17th century, but resumed the role in 1721.

            In 1943 its population of 3,500 largely consisted 
            of Greek Orthodox Christians.[2] At the time, its 
            houses were described as well-built and made of alternating 
            black and white stones and clustered around the
            Crusader-era fortress.[2] In 1960 Safita had a population of 
            4,300 Christians and 1,900 Alawites

            The Crusader fortress "Chastel Blanc", 
            a square tower built in 1202, is well preserved 
            and rises to a height of 28 meters. It is 18 meters 
            wide and 31 meters long. Among its walls, 3 meters high,
            is a chapel dedicated to St. Michael and serving the Greek
            Orthodox community of the city. The 
            second floor of the building, which can be 
            ascended in a stone staircase, was originally used as
            a dormitory and is illuminated by firing slits.
            Beneath the tower was a water cistern that was
            used by the inhabitants of the fortress.
